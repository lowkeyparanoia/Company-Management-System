# Company-Management-System
A startup system designed in Java using the Command Design Pattern.

## H2 Goal
To design a startup management system to administer the employment of new employees and their allocation to their position respectively. Moreover, it addresses the problem of leave-taking and assigning new heads for the project being worked on.
As of yet, I haven't developed a GUI for the application. However, work is ongoing to get it up and running using JavaFX/Swing.


### H3 Note on Design Patterns
  The Command Desing Pattern is one of the most famous creational patterns employed in OOP. In this project, I've made extensive use of custom exceptions, user-defined classes and employed interfaces to branch out commands as separate types.
  The pattern allows modularity and enables execution at one point and the side effects propagated to objects through their respective methods rather than procedurally method-stacking in one programme. This allows for cleaner, more readable code.
  
Stay Crazy.
